The game I just made could be turned into an assignment.

Give students the majority of the code except for a couple specific pieces and have them implement those specific pieces.

The biggest piece to implement would be developing the algorithm by which the computer guesses a player’s code.

This would give students some creative license in how they actually implement the guessing algorithm, and allows the teacher to see how well students develop their own algorithms.

Score their algorithm by speed, and by quality.

Determine the quality of the algorithm by seeing if their computer’s guesses got closer to the correct answer each time.

This can be measured by scoring the feedback the computer gets for each guess. Each hint could be quantified by the sum of 2 for each asterisk and 1 for each hyphen. Then put the scores of each feedback in a list and see if the scores are improving. If the scores are in sorted order thats 3 points for the quality of the algorithm. If the average of the scores in the second half of the list is larger than the average of the scores in the first half of the list thats 1 point for the quality of the algorithm. If the computer ultimately guessed the correct answer that’s a bonus point.

Conceivably this could be a larger project whereby students write the entire program of the game over the course of multiple assignments.
